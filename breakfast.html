          <p class="fish-recipeRight">In a blender or food processor combine all ingredients (if you don’t want them to be sweet, take out the sugar and vanilla). Cover and refrigerate about an hour (don’t skip this step, it is very important).
            Heat a skillet* over medium-high heat and spray with cooking spray or oil.
            Pour ¼ cup of the batter into pan, tilting to completely coat the surface of the pan (kind of like how you would if you were trying to coat the pan with oil).
            Cook 3-4 minutes, flipping over once, until golden. The thinner the crepe, the better!

          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Basic Avocado Toast:
            Remove half an avocado from its shell and pit and place it in a small bowl. Lightly mash it with a fork and add salt and pepper, or slice it.
            Spread the avocado mixture over the toast and top with red pepper flakes.
            Avocado Toast with Egg:
            Remove half an avocado from its shell. Lightly mash it with salt and pepper, or slice it.
            Spread the avocado over the toast and top with sliced cherry tomatoes, egg, salt, and pepper.
            Honey Feta Avocado Toast:
            Remove half an avocado from its shell. Lightly mash it with salt and pepper, or slice it.

          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Layer ¼ – ⅓ cup of mixed berries in the bottom of each cup. 
            Next, spoon about ¼ – ⅓ cup of yogurt on top of the berries.  
            Continue layering until the cup is as full as you would like (with yogurt being the top layer).
            Fill a snack-sized ziploc bag with granola and seal (one for each cup). 
            Cover each cup tightly with plastic wrap and seal with rubber band. Place (or tie on) a granola bag on each cup along with a plastic spoon (see picture above). Place in refrigerator for up to 5 days.

          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Beat eggs gently in a small mixing bowl. Try to avoid making air bubbles.
            Pour egg mixture into a nonstick skillet or pan (do NOT preheat the pan). Add 1 Tablespoon cold butter.
            Turn heat to medium-high. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir constantly until butter melts and curds begin to form. Remove from heat and continue stirring until soft curds begin to form. You can return the pan to the heat for a few seconds at a time to continue cooking curds if needed. You want soft, creamy eggs. Do not over cook.
            Season with salt and pepper after the soft curds have formed. Fold in creme fraiche until eggs are lightly coated. Garnish with green onion (optional) and serve immediately.

          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Mix eggs, maple syrup, milk, and vanilla together with a fork and pour in a shallow dish.
            Spread a good amount of cream cheese on each slice of bread. Add the ham and turkey, a fried egg, and a slice of Swiss cheese to one slice of bread and top with another slice of bread making a sandwich.
            Dip each sandwich in the egg mixture and turn over so the the entire outside of the sandwich is coated in the egg mixture.
            Cook on a skillet or in a frying pan over medium heat as if you were making French toast.

          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Warm flour tortillas in oven or microwave.  If using raw tortillas, prepare them according to package directions.
            Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Set aside.
            In a large skillet, cook preferred breakfast meat.  If using diced ham, use a little oil or cooking spray in the pan before heating.
            Remove meat from the skillet and set aside.  If using sausage or bacon, drain grease from the pan leaving a little in the pan for cooking the vegetables (optional) and the eggs.
            Sautée vegetables or hash browns in 1 tablespoon of cooking oil or remaining bacon or sausage grease (optional). Remove everything from the skillet and set aside.
            Add egg mixture and stir until eggs are scrambled and cooked through.
            Prepare your burritos by adding eggs, cheese, meat, and any other ingredients onto each tortilla.
            Roll each tortilla into a burrito and serve with toppings.
