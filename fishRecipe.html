      <h1 class="fish-headingRight">Baked Cod Recipe With Lemon And Garlic</h1>
      <p class="fish-recipeRight">First, start by lightly coating the cod fillets in some well-seasoned flour. To do this, prepare a dredging station.
        In one shallow bowl prepare the lemon sauce by mixing together 5 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and 2 tbsp melted butter.
        In another shallow bowl, mix together ⅓ cup all-purpose flour with 1 tsp ground coriander, ¾ tsp sweet Spanish paprika, ¾ tsp ground cumin, and ¾ tsp kosher salt.
        Dip the fish in the lemon sauce, then coat it well with the flour mixture. Keep the lemon sauce for later use.
        Sear the fish. To give the cod some good color and texture, sear it in olive oil for about 2 minutes on each side.
        Add the lemon sauce. Now, to the lemon sauce, add 5 minced garlic cloves (so much flavor), then pour it over the cod.
        Bake in 400 degrees F heated oven for about 10 minutes or until the cod is cooked through. The fish is ready when it turns a beautiful white opaque and flakes easily when you take a fork to it.
        Garnish and serve! I love adding some parsley for a pop of green!

      <h1 class="fish-headingLeft">Baked White Fish Recipe, Mediterranean-Style</h1>
      <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Season the fish.
      Pat your fish dry and season with kosher salt and black pepper on both sides. Squeeze a little lemon juice on top.
      Make the tomato and olive mixture.
      In a bowl, combine halved cherry tomatoes (about 8 ounces), chopped olives, and minced red onion. Add a pinch of kosher salt and black pepper, and more of the thyme, oregano and garlic. Drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil and toss to combine.
      Assemble and bake.
      Top the white fish fillet with the tomato and olive mixture and bake in a 425 degrees F heated-oven for about 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily.

      <h1 class="fish-headingRight">Fish Piccata</h1>
      <p class="fish-recipeRight">Season and dredge the fish.
        Give the fish a quick sprinkle of kosher salt and black pepper on both sides, then add oregano, paprika and garlic powder (if your left the skin on the fish, you can just add the seasoning to the flesh side). Coat each fish fillet with a bit of the flour. Give it a quick shake to remove excess flour. If you have the time, set the fish aside for 5 minutes or so.
        Pan-Sear the fish.
        Heat up some olive oil and a bit of the unsalted butter in a large pan. Cook the fish on both sides for 2 to 3 minutes or until the fish is firm and flaky (do not over-cook the fish). Transfer the fish to a large tray lined with paper towels to drain the oil.
        Make the piccata sauce.
        In the same pan, add a little more butter and turn the heat down a bit. Add the lemon juice, white wine and capers. Let the sauce simmer briefly over medium heat.
        Add the fish to the sauce.
        Return the fish to the pan and spoon the sauce all over. At this point, you just need a few seconds for the fish to warm through and take in the sauce, you can even turn the heat off so you don't over-cook the fish.
        Garnish and serve.
        I like a pop of green parsley and a pinch of red pepper flakes, but that is totally optional. You can also add a few lemon slices on top. Serve immediately.

      <h1 class="fish-headingLeft">Greek-Style Roasted Branzino</h1>
      <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Season the branzino. After patting the branzino dry, make two slits on both sides of the fish. Generously season with kosher salt and black pepper on both sides, as well as through the slits and in the cavity. Insert half a sliced lemon and half a sliced red onion into the fish cavity.
        Roast the whole branzino and make the ladolemono sauce if using. Place the fish on a lightly oiled sheet pan that is big enough to accommodate it. Roast in the center rack of a 400 degrees F heated oven for 5 minutes on one side, then carefully turn over (you might need a large spatula for this as the fish is quite flimsy) and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes (or until the fish is cooked and flakes easily). Cooked fish will have an internal temperature of 145 degrees F when checked with a meat thermometer. Turn the broiler on and broil the branzino about 6 inches from the heat source for 3 to 4 minutes (or until the skin chars). 

        While the fish bakes, make the ladolemono sauce by adding the lemon juice, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper to a bowl and whisking them. While whisking, slowly drizzle the extra virgin olive oil into the bowl. This helps the sauce emulsify and thicken.
        Serve. Transfer the Mediterranean branzino to a platter and drizzle immediately with ladolemono sauce. Use as much as you like, and be sure to pour the sauce into the cavity of the fish as well. After lightly salting a cup of halved cherry tomatoes, spoon them over the fish. If you like, you can drizzle more ladolemono over the tomatoes. Finish with fresh chopped dill. Serve immediately.

      <h1 class="fish-headingRight">Garlic Parmesan Baked Flounder</h1>
      <p class="fish-recipeRight">Season the fish and vegetables. Pat 1 ¼ pounds of flounder fillets dry and season them on both sides with kosher salt and black pepper. Arrange the fish in a large oven-safe dish and add the vegetables (2 medium zucchini and 1 small red onion, both halved and sliced into half moons). Season the veggies with salt and pepper as well.  
        Make the sauce. Whisk together 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 teaspoons dried oregano, ½ teaspoon each paprika and cumin, the juice of 2 lemons, and about ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil in a small bowl.
        Pour the sauce mixture over the fish and vegetables to coat them well.
        Bake the flounder and vegetables. Bake in a 350 degrees F heated oven for 7 to 10 minutes. Wearing oven mitts, remove the baking dish and sprinkle ½ cup grated parmesan over the flounder and veg. Place the pan back in the oven and bake for 5 minutes or so more until the flounder is flaky and the cheese has melted a bit. Remove from the oven and serve hot.

      <h1 class="fish-headingLeft">Mediterranean Baked Red Snapper With Bell Peppers</h1>
      <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Season the whole red snapper. Make 3 slits on both sides of each fish. Insert 15 cloves minced garlic (that have been mixed with a pinch of salt) into the slits and also inside the fish cavity (the cleaned gut). In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons cumin, 2 teaspoons coriander, 1 teaspoon sumac, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and kosher salt. Use about ¾ of the spice mixture to season the fish, both the outside and inside (inserting some into the slits you made earlier).
        Prepare the vegetables and herbs. Chop fresh dill (you need ½ cup). Slice 3 large bell peppers (different colors), a large tomato, and 1 medium red onion into rounds. Stuff each gut cavity with as much of the dill and sliced vegetables as possible.
        Roast the whole fish. Place the stuffed fish on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Arrange the remaining sliced vegetables around the fish. Sprinkle the vegetables with a pinch of salt and the remaining ¼ spice mixture. Drizzle everything generously with good extra virgin olive oil. Roast on the middle rack of a 425 degree heated oven until the fish is cooked. Cooked fish has an internal temperature of 137 degrees F and will flake easily. Whole red snapper will take 20 to 25 minutes to roast.
        Finish and serve. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and transfer it to a serving platter. While the fish is still hot, squeeze the juice of one lemon generously over the top of the fish. Use the slits you made to help you cut and portion the fish. Serve with wedges of the remaining lemon and a side of your choice.
