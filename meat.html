          <h1 class="fish-headingRight">TUNA PASTA SALAD WITH PEAS</h1>
          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Make the dressing first. Combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, dill, salt, and pepper in a bowl, then set the dressing aside.
            Finely dice the red onion and measure out the frozen peas.
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until it's almost fully tender (about 5-6 minutes), then add the frozen peas. Continue to cook the pasta and peas together for the last minute or two, or until the pasta is fully tender. Drain the pasta and peas well in a colander, allowing them to cool.
            Once the pasta and peas are well drained and mostly cooled, transfer them to a large bowl. Add the diced red onion, drained tuna, and prepared dressing. Fold the ingredients together until everything is evenly combined and coated in dressing. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

          <h1 class="fish-headingLeft">CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS</h1>
          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">First, make the sauce for the chicken lettuce wraps. In a small bowl combine the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, fresh grated ginger and minced garlic. Set the sauce aside.
            Next chop the red bell pepper and water chestnuts into similar size pieces. Then slice the green onions and give the peanuts a rough chop. Set veggies and nuts aside.
            Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the cooking oil. Once oil is heated, add the ground chicken, crumble and cook until browned.
            Add the red bell pepper and water chestnuts to the skillet. Saute for two minutes.
            Pour the prepared sauce mixture into the skillet and mix well. Cook for two more minutes to allow the sauce to soak into the chicken and vegetables. Remove from the heat and top with green onions and chopped peanuts.
            Next, make the peanut lime dressing. In a small bowl combine the natural style peanut butter, brown sugar, minced garlic clove, freshly grated ginger, 1 Tbsp of lime juice, soy sauce, and the neutral oil. Whisk or stir together well and set aside.
            Serve 1/3 cup of the chicken and vegetable mixture inside each lettuce wrap and drizzle a little of the peanut lime dressing on top. Enjoy!

          <h1 class="fish-headingRight">SAUSAGE KEBABS</h1>
          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Slice the sausage into ½-inch thick rounds. Chop the onions and bell peppers into 1-inch pieces.
            Place the sausage and vegetables in a large bowl. Drizzle the cooking oil over top. Combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, then sprinkle over the sausage and vegetables.
            Toss the sausage and vegetables until well coated in oil and spices.
            Build the kebabs by skewering the sausage and vegetables in an alternating sequence. You should get about eight kebabs, depending on the size of your skewers and vegetables.
            Cook the kebabs over a hot grill, on a hot cast iron grill pan (preheated well over medium-high heat), or under your oven's broiler (about 5-6 inches from the broiler) until the kebabs are slightly charred on one side.
            Flip the kebabs and continue to cook until charred on a second side. Brush a light coating of BBQ sauce over the side that has already been charred. Continue to cook, turn, and brush on BBQ sauce until the kebabs are charred on all sides and the BBQ sauce is slightly caramelized. Serve hot and enjoy!

          <h1 class="fish-headingLeft">AIR FRYER FRIED CHICKEN</h1>
          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Mix the smoked paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, buttermilk, and egg in a large bowl.
            Place chicken in the bowl and mix until all of the chicken is covered. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the chicken. Marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, preferably 2 hours.
            Preheat your air-fryer to 300°F. Mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Remove one piece of chicken from the brine, shake off the excess brine, and dredge it in the flour mixture. Set it aside and repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken.
            Spray cooking oil in your air fryer basket until it is completely covered. Place the chicken in the basket in a single layer, making sure no pieces overlap. Spray the top of the chicken with cooking oil until thoroughly covered. Cook for 20 minutes at 300°F.
            Carefully flip the chicken pieces so as not to destroy the crust. Spray the top surface of the chicken again with cooking oil until thoroughly covered.
            Cook for 15 to 20 minutes at 400°F, or until chicken skin is crispy and golden and the internal temperature is 160°F. Insert the thermometer in the thickest part of the chicken without touching the bone. Then try not to eat that crispy skin before serving. Forgive yourself if you fail miserably!

          <h1 class="fish-headingRight">SAUSAGE MEATBALLS AND KALE SHEET PAN MEAL</h1>
          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Preheat oven to 450°F. Place quartered red potatoes in a large bowl and drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil. Mix smoked paprika, 2 teaspoons of salt, black pepper, and chili flakes. Sprinkle over the potatoes and toss. Place the potatoes in a sheet pan.
            In the same bowl, add the tomatoes and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Scatter them over the potatoes.
            Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Break up Italian sausage in a large bowl. Mix in breadcrumbs and egg. Wet your fingers with a bit of leftover oil from the bowl the tomatoes were in. Roll 16 meatballs and place them on the sheet pan between the potatoes and tomatoes.
            Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the meatballs and bake for another 10 minutes.
            While the meatballs bake, add 1/2 lb of the kale to the same bowl the potatoes and tomatoes were in. Mix red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup olive oil, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Toss the kale in the dressing, massaging it into the leaves.
            Remove the sheet pan from the oven, and scatter kale all over.
            Roast for 3 to 4 minutes until the kale has charred in spots. To serve, split raw kale between 4 bowls. Top with charred kale and tomatoes and mix. Finally, top with meatballs and potatoes.

          <h1 class="fish-headingLeft">BACON LETTUCE TOMATO PASTA SALAD</h1>
          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until brown and crispy. Transfer the cooked bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool. Once cooled, chop or crumble the bacon into smaller pieces.
            While the bacon is cooking, prepare the dressing. Stir together the mayonnaise, ranch dressing, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Set the dressing aside.
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until tender (7-8 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander, rinse it briefly with cool water to cool it down, then let it drain very well.
            While the pasta is cooking and draining, prepare the vegetables. Slice the grape tomatoes in half, finely dice the red onion, and roughly chop the spinach.
            Once the pasta is cooled and drained, add it to a large bowl along with the spinach, tomatoes, onions, and dressing. Stir everything together until evenly combined and coated in dressing. Let the pasta sit for 10-15 minutes for the flavors to blend, then stir once more and serve.
