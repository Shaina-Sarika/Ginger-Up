          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Scoop the avocados into a blender along with the melted chocolate chips, cacao powder, maple syrup, almond butter, vanilla, almond milk, and sea salt. Blend until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds and freeze overnight, or for at least 9 hours.
            To remove the pops, let them sit at room temperature for a few minutes until the pops are loose enough to pull out.
            Optional topping: Melt the additional chocolate chips together with the coconut oil. Drizzle on the pops and sprinkle the crushed nuts on top.
            Alternatively, you can enjoy this as pudding in non-pop form. After you blend the mixture, scoop it into a bowl, or individual bowls, and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours.

          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">In a small saucepan, heat the almond milk over low heat. Add the chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon, and whisk for 15 minutes, or until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and warmed through.
            Add the maple syrup and bourbon, if using, and stir to combine. Serve hot with whipped cream or chocolate shavings, if desired.

          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Preheat the oven to 350°F and lightly spray two 8x4” loaf pans with nonstick spray.
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, the cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
            In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, almond milk, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla. Stir in the zucchini. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Don’t overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips.
            Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle with more chocolate chips and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the tops spring back to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.

          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
            In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
            In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
            Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
            Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!

          <p class="fish-recipeRight">Make the sweet potato frosting: Preheat the oven to 425°F. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the sweet potato. Place on a baking sheet or on a piece of foil and roast until very tender, about 60 minutes. Let the potatoes cool slightly, then measure 3/4 cups of the soft flesh. In a (small) food processor, puree the sweet potato, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, coconut oil, and salt. The heat of the sweet potato will melt the chocolate.
            Make the cake. Reduce the oven heat to 350°F and grease an 8x8 baking pan.
            In a large bowl, stir together the flours, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. To the same bowl, add the almond milk, maple syrup, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla. Stir until combined.
            Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top of the cake springs back when pressed or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Place the pan on cooling racks and cool for 10 minutes.
            Gently loosen the sides of each cake with a knife. Remove the cakes from the pan and place back on the racks to cool completely. Frost the cake and serve!

          <p class="fish-recipeLeft">Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with coconut oil.
            In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed and water and set aside to thicken. Stir the vinegar into the almond milk and set aside.
            In a large bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flaxseed mixture, almond milk/vinegar mixture, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla.
            Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Don’t over mix. Fold in the zucchini.
            Pour the batter into the baking dish and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top of the cake springs back to the touch. Cool completely before frosting.
            Make the frosting: In a blender, combine the cashews, almond milk, powdered sugar, coconut oil, vanilla, matcha, and sea salt and process until smooth and creamy. Add more matcha, if desired. Chill until ready to use, or for at least 20 minutes to firm up.
